# Mental Health and Workplace Well-being Report

## 1. Executive Summary
> This analysis was done to identify workplace and lifestyle factors associated with depression, aiming to improve workplace well-being.

> **Key finding**: It is found that high work pressure and unhealthy dietary habits increase depression risk, while job satisfaction and sufficient sleep are protective.”

> Recommendations for HR include promoting healthy eating, encouraging work–life balance, etc.

## 2. Descriptive analysis

1. The sample contains a group of participants whose age range from 18 to 60, with an average age of 39.
2. The sample is well-distributed and representative, with similar percentage of male and female samples, and the median value in each factors are also close to median value, except Work/Study hours, which has a distinctive higher standard deviation (3.77) compared to median (6).
3. There are a lot of missing values from the column 'Academic Pressure' , 'CPGA' and 'Study Satisfaction' (all around 80%) due to the fact that the survey is mainly aimed at working professionals. Therefore, this variable will not be taken into consideration for later analysis.
4. From the scatter plot matrix, there are a few observation between several factors that potentially leads to depression.
    * Work/Study Hours vs. Depression

        Bottom-right scatter plots show that the orange points (Depression = Yes) are more common at higher work/study hours. This does suggest that longer work/study time might be associated with higher depression likelihood.

    * Job Satisfaction vs. Depression

        Orange points cluster toward lower job satisfaction values, indicating that lower satisfaction may be related to depression risk.

    * Work Pressure vs. Depression

        Orange points are more common in higher work pressure levels, though not as strong as the job satisfaction pattern. This fits with the idea that high work pressure could be a contributing factor.

    * Sleep Hours Numeric vs. Depression

        There’s no consistent linear pattern as both orange points in both low and high sleep durations. This could mean that sleep duration alone doesn’t explain depression risk — maybe sleep quality or sleep consistency would be more important, but those aren’t in the dataset.

    In conclusion, work pressure, job satisfaction, sleep duration, and work/study Hours are all correlated to some extent, potentially leading to depression. Therefore, the sample dataset serves a valid tool for our anlysis.

## 3. Exploratory data analysis

A logistic regression was conducted to examine the factors associated with depression among 2,556 respondents. The model was statistically significant (LLR p < 0.001) and explained a substantial proportion of variance (Pseudo R² = 0.612).

---

Several predictors were found to have strong and significant associations with depression:


    * Suicidal thoughts emerged as the strongest predictor (OR ≈ 35.6, p < 0.001). Individuals who reported suicidal thoughts were more than 35 times as likely to report depression compared to those who did not.

    * Unhealthy dietary habits were also strongly associated with depression (OR ≈ 5.1, p < 0.001).

    * Work pressure increased the odds of depression nearly threefold (OR ≈ 2.7, p < 0.001).

    * Job satisfaction was protective: each unit increase in satisfaction reduced the odds of depression by approximately 63% (OR ≈ 0.37, p < 0.001).

    * Age was also protective (OR ≈ 0.74 per unit, p < 0.001), suggesting younger individuals had higher odds of depression.
---
With regard to sleep:

    * Sleeping more than 8 hours was associated with reduced depression risk (OR ≈ 0.55, p = 0.018).
    * Sleeping 7–8 hours showed a borderline protective effect (p = 0.052).

    * Sleeping less than 5 hours was associated with increased risk, though this was not statistically significant (p = 0.143).

    * Gender did not have a significant effect (p = 0.676).

## 4. Discussion

    The findings highlight the strong role of psychosocial and lifestyle factors in predicting depression. Suicidal ideation is the most powerful predictor. Job-related stressors also played an important role: higher work pressure increased the risk of depression, whereas greater job satisfaction was protective.

    Dietary habits were another important predictor: unhealthy eating patterns significantly increased the odds of depression, supporting the growing body of evidence linking nutrition and mental health.

    Sleep duration showed mixed effects. While longer sleep (>8 hours) was protective, shorter sleep (<5 hours) increased risk but did not reach statistical significance. This may reflect sample size, measurement error, or the complexity of sleep–mental health interactions.

    Interestingly, gender was not a significant predictor in this sample, in contrast with some prior studies that report higher depression prevalence among females. This suggests that other lifestyle and psychosocial factors may play a more dominant role in this dataset.

## 5. Potential Pitfalls & Limitations
    
    * Self-report bias: 
    Responses rely on participants’ honesty.

    * Cross-sectional data: 
    Cannot establish causation, only associations.

    * Survey design bias: 
    Dataset skewed toward working professionals (academic variables largely missing).

    * Unmeasured variables: 
    Factors like social support, therapy access, or physical activity not included.

    * Class imbalance: 
    If depression cases are less frequent, odds ratios may appear inflated.

## 6. Recommendations for HR Department
Based on the findings, HR can take proactive steps:

***Workplace Practices***

    * Promote reasonable work hours and hybrid/remote flexibility to reduce work pressure.
    * Encourage managers to track job satisfaction and act on employee feedback.
***Lifestyle & Well-being***

    * Provide access to healthy meals/snacks at workplace.
    * Promote wellness programs (exercise, mindfulness, stress management).
    * Encourage healthy sleep hygiene through awareness campaigns.

***Support Structures***

    * Improve access to mental health services (EAP, counseling, peer support).
    * Create a culture where talking about mental health is normalized.
    * Train managers to recognize warning signs of high stress or depression.

***Compensation & Recognition***

    * Consider fair compensation, bonuses, and benefits to reduce pressure and financial stress.

## 7. Conclusion
This study highlights that depression is strongly linked to workplace stress, lifestyle choices, and job satisfaction. HR can play a central role in mitigating these risks by fostering supportive work environments, promoting healthy habits, and providing accessible mental health resources.
